// ## articles:
// ### note, everything is a draft for the next day or two
//

// * [RSVP, email simplified](rsvp.html) 
"Rethinking email; this is a running draft of a product concept. When
it feels coherent enough, Ill start building it out."

// * [Re-entrant Exceptions in JS](reentrant-exceptions.html)
"If you explicitly control the call stack, then you can fire a missing
method exception, create the method, then resume execution. I learned
about this through Smalltalk TDD literature. I've always wanted it in
JS. So, here's an exploration of what it takes to get there."

// * [Functional Programming, thoughts](functional-programming.html) (draft)

// * [Code Equals Data Equals Code: JS metaprogramming](code-equals-data-equals-code.html) (draft)
"If you keep things simple, going from code to data and back is tractable."

// * [There's a Bluebird in my Heart: combinators in JS](theres-a-bluebird-in-my-heart.html) (draft)
"JS coverage of birdie characters from _To Mock a Mockingbird_."
