// ## articles:
// ### note, *everything* is a draft at the moment :-)
//
// curious what's new? check the [github commit logs](https://github.com/6a68/6a68.github.com/commits/master)

// ### producty

// * Twitter with attenuation
"I sometimes wish I could turn down the frequency of certain feeds
within my global twitter stream. All you'd need is one slider per
person, to limit them to 1 or 5 or 10 per day (or just apply no limit,
the default standard setting). There's no article here yet; I might
just build this out and see if I like it."

// * [RSVP, email simplified](rsvp.html) 
"Rethinking email; this is a running draft of a product concept. When
it feels coherent enough, Ill start building it out."

// ### geekcore

// * [Re-entrant Exceptions in JS](reentrant-exceptions.html)
"If you explicitly control the call stack, then you can fire a missing
method exception, create the method, then resume execution. I learned
about this through Smalltalk TDD literature. I've always wanted it in
JS. So, here's an exploration of what it takes to get there."

// * [Front-end architecture tradeoffs](frontend-architecture-patterns.html)
"There's a lot of talk about lightweight vs heavyweight approaches to
writing front-end code, but evangelists don't talk nearly as much about
which problems are best solved by their favorite tool or framework. This
is a first pass at listing the factors to consider before choosing the
tools to use in building a given project."

// * [JavaScript dependency management: an epic interview question](interview-problems-dependency-manager.html)
"Building a dependency manager in JS touches on a lot of interesting areas
you might want to cover in a programming interview, and it's a practical enough
problem that people without a comp sci background could still have fun and
make headway. I've never been asked this question, and since I'm publishing
my discussion about it, I'll never ask it, but I think it's a cool problem,
which is why I'm sharing it. The only thing missing is that my formulation of
the problem doesn't test for DOM knowledge, but it's easily a big enough task
to fill an hour with good discussion."

// * [There's a Bluebird in my Heart: combinators in JS](theres-a-bluebird-in-my-heart.html)
"JS coverage of birdie characters from _To Mock a Mockingbird_."

// * [Functional Programming, thoughts](functional-programming.html)

// * [Code Equals Data Equals Code: JS metaprogramming](code-equals-data-equals-code.html)
"If you keep things simple, going from code to data and back is tractable."

// ### code

// * [some jQuery components from meebo days, pulled from the CDN and annotated](meebo-jquery.html)
// * todo: find some YUI components and post those (much more interesting JS)

// * [fontbomb: somebody else's code, annotated](fontbomb.html)

"Fontbomb is a clever little project with a surprisingly well-written codebase.
I had nothing to do with it and don't know the author, but I really enjoyed looking
through the code--surprisingly well-written, for what looks like a fun little
one-off project. I'm publishing my notes here as an experiment in public obscurity."
