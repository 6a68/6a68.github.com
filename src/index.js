// [Big performance wins by optimizing fonts](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/fantastic-front-end-performance-part-3-big-performance-wins-by-optimizing-fonts-a-node-js-holiday-season-part-8/)
// <br>*published on [Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org)*
// <br>2013-03-19 &middot; *Geekcore*

"Another contribution to the Identity team's node blog series.
This time, talking about font subsetting and connect-fonts, a sweet
little middleware that serves up i18n'd subsets for you, plus
manages CORS headers and generated CSS @font-face declarations."

// [@font-face links for the connect-fonts article](https://gist.github.com/6a68/5187976)
// <br>2013-03-19 &middot; *Geekcore*

"Support material for connect-fonts article: a sparsely-annotated
list of @font-face links."

// [simple horiz-bar graffage](https://gist.github.com/6a68/5166525)
// <br>2013-03-19 &middot; *Geekcore*

"d3.js material taken from a tutorial and extended. Used to generate
the horizontal bar graphs in the connect-fonts article, and made public
in the hopes that someone else can do something with it."


// [Caching dynamic content with etagify](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/fantastic-front-end-performance-in-node-part-2-a-node-js-holiday-season-part-6/)
// <br>*published on [Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org)*
// <br>2013-02-20 &middot; *Geekcore*

"First blog post for a significant audience. Part of an
ongoing node.js series by my team at Mozilla, the Identity
team. The concrete example was an intro to connect-etagify,
the broader themes were:
  * to build simple libraries, focus on the problem at hand
  * measure your optimizations & use stats to test your measurements"

// [All about ETags](https://gist.github.com/6a68/4971859)
// <br>2013-02-20 &middot; *Geekcore*

"Support material for the etagify article. Originally, I'd
planned to include material on statistics and on HTTP caching,
but this 1000 words came out to streamline the main exposition.
I cover some pretty far-out applications at the end, like
optimistic concurrency via conditional PUT."


// [Backup your tumblr with wget](https://gist.github.com/4354202)
// <br>2012-12-21 &middot; *Nerdcore*

"After the instagram TOS drama, I decided to download
my old tumblr photoblog. Rather than just google for
somebody else's one-liner, I read the wget man page,
like a Real Neckbeard. It was surprisingly fun; I took
notes along the way and and threw them in a Gist for
the sake of future searchers."

"Classified under nerdcore because it's not really geeky
enough to compare with the spooky PLT stuff below ;-)"

// [fontbomb: somebody else's code, annotated](fontbomb.html)
// <br>2012-07-07 &middot; *Code*

"Fontbomb is a clever little project with a surprisingly
well-written codebase. I had nothing to do with it and
don't know the author, but I really enjoyed looking
through the code--surprisingly well-written, for what
looks like a fun little one-off project. I'm publishing
my notes here as an experiment in public obscurity."

// [JavaScript dependency management: an epic interview question](interview-problems-dependency-manager.html)
// <br>2012-06-23 &middot; *Geekcore* *Incomplete*
"Building a dependency manager in JS touches on a lot of
interesting areas you might want to cover in a programming
interview, and it's a practical enough problem that people
without a comp sci background could still have fun and
make headway. I've never been asked this question, and
since I'm publishing my discussion about it, I'll never
ask it, but I think it's a cool problem, which is why
I'm sharing it. The only thing missing is that my formu-
lation of the problem doesn't test for DOM knowledge, but
it's easily a big enough task to fill an hour with good discussion."

// [Front-end architecture tradeoffs](frontend-architecture-patterns.html)
// <br>2012-06-22 &middot; *Geekcore* *Incomplete*
"There's a lot of talk about lightweight vs heavyweight
approaches to writing front-end code, but evangelists
don't talk nearly as much about which problems are best
solved by their favorite tool or framework. This is a
first pass at listing the factors to consider before
choosing the tools to use in building a given project."

// [Re-entrant Exceptions in JS](reentrant-exceptions.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-06-13 &middot; *Geekcore* *Incomplete*
"If you explicitly control the call stack, then you can
fire a missing method exception, create the method, then
resume execution. I learned about this through Smalltalk
TDD literature. I've always wanted it in JS. So, here's
an exploration of what it takes to get there."

// [some jQuery components from meebo days, pulled from the CDN and annotated](meebo-jquery.html)
// <br>2012-06-11 &middot; *Code*
"todo: find some YUI components and post those (much more interesting JS)"

// [There's a Bluebird in my Heart: combinators in JS](theres-a-bluebird-in-my-heart.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-06-10 &middot; *Geekcore* *Incomplete*
"JS coverage of birdie characters from _To Mock a Mockingbird_."

// [RSVP, email simplified](rsvp.html) 
// <br>Last updated 2012-06-08 &middot; *Producty* *Ongoing*
"Rethinking email; this is a running draft of a product concept. When
it feels coherent enough, Ill start building it out."

// [Functional Programming, thoughts](functional-programming.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-05-31 &middot; *Geekcore* *Incomplete*

// [Code Equals Data Equals Code: JS metaprogramming](code-equals-data-equals-code.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-05-31 &middot; *Geekcore* *Incomplete*
"If you keep things simple, going from code to data and back is tractable."
