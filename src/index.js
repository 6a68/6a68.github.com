// ## articles:
// ### note, *everything* is a draft at the moment :-)

// [fontbomb: somebody else's code, annotated](fontbomb.html)
// <br>2012-07-07 &middot; *Code*

"Fontbomb is a clever little project with a surprisingly well-written codebase.
I had nothing to do with it and don't know the author, but I really enjoyed looking
through the code--surprisingly well-written, for what looks like a fun little
one-off project. I'm publishing my notes here as an experiment in public obscurity."

// [JavaScript dependency management: an epic interview question](interview-problems-dependency-manager.html)
// <br>2012-06-23 &middot; *Geekcore*
"Building a dependency manager in JS touches on a lot of interesting areas
you might want to cover in a programming interview, and it's a practical enough
problem that people without a comp sci background could still have fun and
make headway. I've never been asked this question, and since I'm publishing
my discussion about it, I'll never ask it, but I think it's a cool problem,
which is why I'm sharing it. The only thing missing is that my formulation of
the problem doesn't test for DOM knowledge, but it's easily a big enough task
to fill an hour with good discussion."

// [Front-end architecture tradeoffs](frontend-architecture-patterns.html)
// <br>2012-06-22 &middot; *Geekcore*
"There's a lot of talk about lightweight vs heavyweight approaches to
writing front-end code, but evangelists don't talk nearly as much about
which problems are best solved by their favorite tool or framework. This
is a first pass at listing the factors to consider before choosing the
tools to use in building a given project."

// [Re-entrant Exceptions in JS](reentrant-exceptions.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-06-13 &middot; *Geekcore*
"If you explicitly control the call stack, then you can fire a missing
method exception, create the method, then resume execution. I learned
about this through Smalltalk TDD literature. I've always wanted it in
JS. So, here's an exploration of what it takes to get there."

// [some jQuery components from meebo days, pulled from the CDN and annotated](meebo-jquery.html)
// <br>2012-06-11 &middot; *Code*
"todo: find some YUI components and post those (much more interesting JS)"

// [There's a Bluebird in my Heart: combinators in JS](theres-a-bluebird-in-my-heart.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-06-10 &middot; *Geekcore*
"JS coverage of birdie characters from _To Mock a Mockingbird_."

// [RSVP, email simplified](rsvp.html) 
// <br>Last updated 2012-06-08 &middot; *Producty*
"Rethinking email; this is a running draft of a product concept. When
it feels coherent enough, Ill start building it out."

// [Functional Programming, thoughts](functional-programming.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-05-31 &middot; *Geekcore*

// [Code Equals Data Equals Code: JS metaprogramming](code-equals-data-equals-code.html)
// <br>Last updated 2012-05-31 &middot; *Geekcore*
"If you keep things simple, going from code to data and back is tractable."
